# What is Unity? 

Unity is a tool for creating interactive experiences. It allows designers and artists to turn visual ideas, spaces, and objects into systems that react to users in real time. Instead of focusing on static images or pre-rendered animations, Unity is about interaction, movement, and behavior.

While tools like Blender are used to design and model visual elements, Unity is the place where these elements are staged, combined, and activated. In Unity, designers work with scenes, cameras, light, time, and interaction—similar to building a spatial composition that can be explored, played, or experienced.

Unity is widely used not only for games, but also for digital art, installations, simulations, and experimental projects that sit between design, technology, and performance.
